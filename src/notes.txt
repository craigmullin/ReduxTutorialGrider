Notes

6/9 Flow:
Redux constructs the State
React provides the View
Redux-React is the link

Reducer returns array of books (data)
Add reducer to rootReducer in index.js
Component -> Container
Containers are aware of State - bonded to the state

Actions/Action Creators
A button click calls an Action Creator
Action Creator returns object (payload) that is sent to all reducers
A reducer can choose to return a different piece of state
